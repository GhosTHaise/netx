# NetX

Netx is a lightweight and powerful utility library for Next.js that simplifies and enhances API calls and Server Actions management.

It automatically detects and types your actions folder, providing a seamless developer experience — with automatic type inference, retry logic for network/server failures, and an intuitive API for calling actions from your client or server components.

## ✨Features

⚙️ Auto-discovery of actions from a dedicated folder (e.g. /actions)

🧠 Automatic TypeScript typings based on your action definitions

🔁 Built-in retry mechanism for handling network/server failures

📦 Zero-config setup — just install and organize your actions

🚀 Optimized for Next.js App Router (compatible with Server Actions)
